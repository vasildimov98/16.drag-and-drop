## Description

Introducing my personal project: a web-based Kibana board with drag and drop functionality, designed specifically for task management. This board simplifies the organization of tasks into four categories: On Hold, Complete, Progress, and Backlog.

Powered by JavaScript, this board offers a seamless user experience, allowing users to effortlessly drag and drop tasks between the different categories. It provides a visually appealing and intuitive interface for tracking the status of tasks and managing workflow effectively.

With its clean and minimalistic design, this Kibana board streamlines task management by offering a centralized platform to visualize and prioritize tasks. Whether you're working on personal projects or collaborating with a team, this board helps you stay organized and focused on completing tasks efficiently.
